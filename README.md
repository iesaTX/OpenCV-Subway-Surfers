# OpenCV-Subway-Surfers
This is a project made by Iesa Patel and Abduraheem Mohammed, where we utilize OpenCV, MediaPipe, and various other python libraries to 
make a hands-free version of Subway Surfers. 

This Project was originally intended as a Science fair/PBL Project but we've decided to upload this publicly.

OpenCV games aren't a new things created by us, but we sourced code from various other creators and compiled it. 

You can directly run this by only using the 'SubwayMotion' File. The other files are snippets of our code.

This was inspired by BleedAi, we took major parts of his code, which was not working and modified it so it would work as intended
